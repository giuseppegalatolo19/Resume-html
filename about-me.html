        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
          I’m an aspiring web developer currently studying the fundamentals of
          front-end development. I enjoy building clean, well-structured web
          pages and learning how the web works under the hood.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m currently focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with particular
          attention to semantic structure and accessibility. Through hands-on
          assignments and small projects, I’m developing a solid foundation in
          web development principles.
        </p>

        <p>
          My previous work experience has taught me the importance of
          reliability, time management, and problem-solving under pressure. I
          approach development with the same mindset: planning carefully,
          learning continuously, and improving through practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m looking for an opportunity to grow as a junior web developer,
          where I can contribute, learn from others, and continue improving my
          technical skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy learning new things and working on
          practical projects that challenge my problem-solving skills. With my
          background as an Artist and Ex student at the Fine Arts Academy of
          Palermo i aim to specialize in crafting beautiful projects blending
          solid structure and nice ui/ux design.
